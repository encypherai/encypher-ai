# TEAM_175 — Clean up API responses & C2PA manifest: remove internal details

## Summary
Multiple internal implementation details were leaking through the public API:
1. Verify response: `total_vs256_signatures` / `total_zw_signatures` keys, `format` field
2. Verify response: marketing site showed only basic manifest, not rich C2PA info
3. C2PA manifest assertions: org ID in `softwareAgent`, `manifest_mode` in metadata, org ID in `publisher.identifier`

## Changes

### enterprise-api (C2PA manifest content)
1. **`app/services/embedding_service.py`** — removed `manifest_mode` from `document_metadata_jsonld`; replaced org ID with org name in `publisher.identifier`; removed org ID from `softwareAgent` in `c2pa.created` action
2. **`app/services/embedding_executor.py`** — thread `organization_name` through to `create_embeddings`
3. **`tests/test_c2pa_conformance_sign_verify.py`** — updated test to assert `manifest_mode` absent; added regression test `test_c2pa_manifest_does_not_leak_internal_details`

### verification-service
4. **`app/api/v1/endpoints.py`** — removed `format` from both ZW and VS256 manifest dicts; renamed `total_zw_signatures` → `total_signatures`
5. **`tests/test_verify_manifest_mode_format.py`** — updated all manifest_mode tests to assert `format` absent; added regression test for `total_signatures`

### marketing-site
6. **`src/components/tools/EncodeDecodeTool.tsx`** — rewrote "C2PA Manifest Data" section to display rich C2PA info; removed `manifest_mode` badge; changed "document" → "content"
7. **`src/lib/enterpriseApiTools.ts`** — fixed `embeddingsFound` to prefer `total_embeddings` from upstream
8. **`src/lib/enterpriseApiTools.test.ts`** — updated fixtures; added `total_embeddings` priority test

### docs
9. **`.teams/TEAM_170_verify_manifest_mode_format.md`** — updated example response

## C2PA Manifest (before → after)

| Field | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `c2pa.actions[0].softwareAgent` | `Encypher Enterprise API/org_07dd...` | `Encypher Enterprise API` |
| `c2pa.metadata.manifest_mode` | `micro_ecc_c2pa` | *(removed)* |
| `c2pa.metadata.publisher.identifier` | `org_07dd7ff77fa7e949` | `Demo Organization` (org name) |
| verify `details.manifest.format` | `micro_ecc_c2pa` | *(removed)* |
| verify `details.manifest.total_zw_signatures` | `13` | renamed to `total_signatures` |

## Test Results
- ✅ 128/128 enterprise-api tests pass (incl. new regression test)
- ✅ 11/11 manifest mode format tests pass (verification-service)
- ✅ 68/68 total verification-service tests pass
- ✅ 86/86 marketing-site tests pass

## Investigation & Fix: "13 of 27 segments" Mismatch

Root cause: WordPress plugin sent raw HTML (with `<!-- wp:paragraph -->` block comments) to `/sign`. The segmenter treated HTML fragments as sentences, inflating the count from 18 actual sentences to ~27 "segments". Only 13 of those were real sentences that got VS256 signatures.

### WordPress Plugin Changes (`class-encypher-provenance-rest.php`)

Implemented the same extract→sign→embed pattern as `tools/encypher-cms-signing-kit`:

1. **`extract_text_from_html($html)`** — strips WP block comments, walks DOM text nodes, joins paragraphs with spaces. Uses DOMDocument for proper HTML parsing.
2. **`embed_signed_text_in_html($html, $signed)`** — string-based approach (avoids DOMDocument::saveHTML mangling). Extracts text fragments with byte offsets, matches against signed text, does direct substr_replace.
3. **`extract_html_text_fragments($html)`** — finds text runs between HTML tags/comments with byte offsets.
4. **Helper methods:** `walk_dom_for_text`, `collect_text_nodes`, `mb_str_split_safe`, `is_vs_char`, `is_vs_or_whitespace`
5. **`handle_sign_request`** updated to call extract→sign→embed flow.

### Results (post 36 "test post 1")

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| DB total_segments | 27 | 18 |
| VS256 signatures in content | 13 | 18 |
| HTML structure preserved | n/a (was plain text) | ✅ wp:paragraph, `<p>` tags |
| Text fragments matched | n/a | 8/8 |

### Bug Fix: Corrupted Block Comments → Nested `<p>` Tags

The old signing process (before our changes) embedded VS chars adjacent to `<!-- /wp:paragraph -->` comments. When VS chars were stripped, a literal space was left behind: `<!-- /wp :paragraph -->`. Gutenberg couldn't parse this, merged blocks, and created nested `<p><p>...</p>...</p>` — triggering "This block contains unexpected or invalid content."

**Fix:** Added `sanitize_wp_block_comments()` method that normalizes all WP block comments to canonical form after VS stripping. Called in `handle_sign_request` after `strip_c2pa_embeddings`.

### Bug Fix: WordPress Verify Button Returns SIGNER_UNKNOWN

The WordPress verify button calls the enterprise API's `/verify/advanced` endpoint. That endpoint's `execute_verification` tried to verify VS256 signatures using only the demo key. Content signed with an org key (`org_07dd7ff77fa7e949`) failed because the demo key doesn't match.

Meanwhile, the website verification tool (marketing site) routes through the **verification service**, which resolves VS256 UUIDs via DB lookup (`_bulk_resolve_segment_uuids` → enterprise API `/public/c2pa/zw/resolve`). No signing key needed.

**Fix:** Added `_resolve_uuids_from_db()` as a fallback in `execute_verification` (step 7 in resolution order). Extracts UUIDs from VS256/ZW signatures without HMAC verification and resolves them via the content DB — same approach the verification service uses.

**Files changed:**
- `enterprise_api/app/services/verification_logic.py` — added `_resolve_uuids_from_db`, `_extract_uuid_from_vs256_signature`, optional `content_db` param
- `enterprise_api/app/routers/verification.py` — pass `content_db` to `execute_verification`

### Bug Fix: Verify Button SIGNATURE_INVALID on New Posts

The signing pipeline now signs **plain text** (extracted from HTML), so the C2PA content hash is computed on plain text. But `handle_verify_request` was sending the **raw HTML** to `/verify/advanced`. The content hash didn't match → `SIGNATURE_INVALID`.

**Fix:** Added `extract_text_for_verify()` method that strips HTML tags and block comments while preserving VS markers (uses `extract_html_text_fragments` at the byte level, not DOMDocument). `handle_verify_request` now sends extracted plain text instead of raw HTML.

### Bug Fix: Website Verify Tool SIGNATURE_INVALID on Copy-Paste

`embed_signed_text_in_html` preserved trailing whitespace from the original HTML `<p>` tag content. The signed text ends with VS markers, but the embed method appended the original trailing space **after** the markers: `text + VS_MARKERS + " "`. When the user copy-pasted from the rendered page, the extra trailing space was included, changing the C2PA content hash → `SIGNATURE_INVALID`.

**Fix:** Removed trailing whitespace preservation in `embed_signed_text_in_html`. Leading whitespace is still preserved. The signed chunk (ending with VS markers) is now the last content in each text node.

### Test Results
- ✅ PHP syntax check: passed
- ✅ 37/37 PHP unit tests pass (`test-html-text-extraction.php`)
- ✅ 6/6 `test_verify_advanced.py` pass
- ✅ 3/3 `test_batch_service.py` pass
- ✅ 3/3 `test_c2pa_conformance_sign_verify.py` pass
- ✅ Integration: WP verify button `valid=true` for post 36 and post 54
- ✅ Integration: verification service `valid=true` for post 54 copy-paste text
- ✅ HTML structure preserved, no nested `<p>` tags, no corrupted block comments

fix(wordpress-plugin): fix copy-paste verification hash mismatch

embed_signed_text_in_html preserved trailing whitespace from the
original HTML <p> tag after VS markers. When users copy-pasted from
the rendered page, the extra space changed the C2PA content hash,
causing SIGNATURE_INVALID in the website verification tool.

Removed trailing whitespace preservation — signed chunk (ending with
VS markers) is now the last content in each text node.

Also in this session:
- extract_text_for_verify: strip HTML while preserving VS markers
- handle_verify_request: send plain text instead of raw HTML
- DB-based UUID resolution in enterprise API execute_verification
- sanitize_wp_block_comments for corrupted block comment repair
